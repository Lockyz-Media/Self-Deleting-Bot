## FAQ
### Why is this archived?
The bot was originally being developed with a MUCH older version of Bit, back when it was called bit-core.

We ended up deciding to update the bots Bit version and instead develop it as a plugin for Bit. This will allow for compatibility with later versions of Bit, and allow the bot to be updated using newer versions of discord.js effectively supporting future Discord features.
